I don't know about you, but when I attempted to unlock, and then subsequently root, my phone I was excited to open up all the possibilities that came with the new prospect. I was as giddy as a school boy. I had no idea the world of #### that I was in for. Now I feel as though I've been deceived, and if you do too then this project is for you.

The only way to ensurer that you know exactly what is going on with your phone is to build it yourself...
